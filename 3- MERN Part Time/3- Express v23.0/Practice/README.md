# Postman + Pokemon


With what we just learned, let's go ahead and use Postman with the Pokemon API. Use Postman to perform 5 different GET requests to retrieve 5 different Pokemon of your choice. Here is a link to the [Pokemon API DOCS](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). 

For instance if we want to find a Pokemon named "Bulbasaur" we could make a request like this.

Or if we want to find a pokemon with an id of 25.

## Requirements:

- Make 5 different GET requests to retrieve 5 different pokemon
- Upload a text file with the requests you made or screenshots of the results
